#Personal
- Been married to my beautiful wife since April 2017
- Had our first child on St. Patrick's Day 2019! He was 2 months early and spent about 3 weeks in the NICU. He's perfectly healthy and we love him more than anything.
- We have two dogs, a Papillon (my wife's before we met) and a Jack Russell (our first fur baby together)
- I'm originally from Chesapeake, VA
- I'm the oldest of three (one brother, one sister)

#Favorite Sports Teams
- __NFL:__ Dallas Cowboys
- __MLB:__ Atlanta Braves
- __NBA:__ I rooted for the Charlotte Hornets growing up, but they'll never be good. I like LeBron. I enjoy all of the offseason drama more than anything.
- __NCAA:__ Old Dominion Monarchs!

#How I Spend My Free Time
- Taking Udemy courses and watching Laracasts
- Smoking ribs for my wife every Sunday
